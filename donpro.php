    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <p>We want to do more and you can help. By committing a small fraction of your income to protect children in need, you can help save a child and contribute to humanity. You can donate as low as INR 500 per month.</p>

    <p>While Save the Children appreciates <span>monthly donations</span> where you choose to donate a small fixed amount monthly for us to be able to plan our programmes for a longer term, a <span>single donation</span> can also help save a child</p>

    <p>You will get your tax exemption certificate within 15 days of your one-time donation (quarterly in case of regular donors, who pledge monthly donations, after their first monthâ€™s donation). You will get quarterly updates on how you are making a difference.</p>
